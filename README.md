The application is a mail service that uses a microservice architecture. It was developed using Golang, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, gRPC, RabbitMQ, and Docker. The microservices are designed to function independently, with their own unique functionalities. RabbitMQ is used for message queuing and gRPC for inter-service communication. Docker is used to containerize the microservices, making them easier to deploy and manage.
